I know this is something outsiders donâ t wanna hear, but Iâ  m a tell it like it is â  McGee is a McBUM to any organization playing sub .500 ball. Not only does the kid think he is better than his actual skill set, but now he got his momma talking up for him . He does NOT have the heart and drive and intelligence defensively of Tyson Chandler. He does NOT have the motor of Andre Jordan. He does NOT have the worth ethic of, hell, Joel Anthony. So what are we specifically holding on to here? Face it: His stats are more "swole" than â   Big Poppa Pump â  during his WCW reign â  anyone who actually WATCHES basketball games can attest that fact. Heâ s a live body, with no moves, who fails to show up as soon as you put a body on him , who immaturity always overshadows any decent play he makes. Offâ   em asap.

We spent more money in past years paying dudes that were no longer on our roster (see Lorenzo Williams , for example), so cut your loses, and keep it moving.

Use â Amnesty Clauseâ on Rashard Lewis Hey Ernie Grunfield , just act like you never traded Gilbert Arenas. You see what Orlando did to Arenas , right? What the hell are you guys waiting on? Lewis is a cancer on the this roster for multiple reasons, but Iâ  ll only mention 3 out of 50. One , everyone knows what heâ  s getting paid this season (22 million). Two , everyone knows he wonâ  t produce a 5 th of what his salary is. Third , everyone knows heâ  s never been a â mentorâ   type player to younger guys.

Only us, the Bullets/Wizards, can have an organization in the booming gentrified Nationâ s Capital, can draft two #1 overall picks in the last 10 years, obtain Michael Jordan during that stretch, and still only compiled a record of 340-497 as of January 24, 2012. Yeah , here is another shameful fact â   Juwan Howard , until further notice, will remain the lone Bullets/Wizards lottery pick in the last 30 years to achieve some sort of brilliance while in a D.C . uniform. Yeah , THAT Juwan . Trade JaVale McGee Is this a young Wizard veteran with TRADE VALUE HERE? When was the last time you heard such? You mean we can rid a good young player for, er, another good young player (and not an old Otis Thorpe , old Issac Austin , old Mitch Richmond , old Bernard King , etc., etc., etc.) You bet yoâ$##! I know this is something outsiders donâ t wanna hear, but Iâ  m a tell it like it is â  McGee is a McBUM to any organization playing sub .500 ball. Not only does the kid think he is better than his actual skill set, but now he got his momma talking up for him . He does NOT have the heart and drive and intelligence defensively of Tyson Chandler. He does NOT have the motor of Andre Jordan. He does NOT have the worth ethic of, hell, Joel Anthony. So what are we specifically holding on to here? Face it: His stats are more "swole" than â   Big Poppa Pump â  during his WCW reign â  anyone who actually WATCHES basketball games can attest that fact. Heâ s a live body, with no moves, who fails to show up as soon as you put a body on him , who immaturity always overshadows any decent play he makes. Offâ   em asap. His trade value wonâ  t get any higher than it is RIGHT now. Cut Andray Blatche We have all heard of the saying â  addition by subtractionâ   right? We spent more money in past years paying dudes that were no longer on our roster (see Lorenzo Williams , for example), so cut your loses, and keep it moving. I bet once this kat leaves D.C. , he wonâ t be in the league more than 2 additional seasons. What more can I say ? Use â Amnesty Clauseâ on Rashard Lewis Hey Ernie Grunfield , just act like you never traded Gilbert Arenas. You see what Orlando did to Arenas , right? What the hell are you guys waiting on? Lewis is a cancer on the this roster for multiple reasons, but Iâ  ll only mention 3 out of 50. One , everyone knows what heâ  s getting paid this season (22 million). Two , everyone knows he wonâ  t produce a 5 th of what his salary is. Third , everyone knows heâ  s never been a â mentorâ   type player to younger guys. I can go on and on like Erykah Badu , but, this is another â  addition by subtractionâ   case here, something us Bullets/Wizards fans are used to dealing with with the team roster year after year. Fire Ernie Grunfield Mr.
