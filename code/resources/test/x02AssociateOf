"Most of the major donors," Clifton wrote, are active philanthropists to 'pro- Israel ' causes both in the U.S. and internationally," who "helped promote the 'Bush doctrine' which led to the invasion of Iraq " and are doing so today with the ginned-up crisis over Iran. Dubowitz told Bloomberg that Obama 's new executive order was "the logical next step in the 'administration's economic war on the Iranian regime'." He gloated that "freezing assets of Iran 's central bank and its government institutions, including the National Iranian Oil Company , makes them 'subject to much tougher enforcement by the U.S. government and the global financial sector'." In response, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ramin Mehmanparast told Tehran Times Tuesday, that "the issue of sanctions pursued by Western countries and U.S. officials is not a new issue.
