We can recognize liberals and conservatives, even bourgeois bohemians and tories, in (for example) the Isabel Dalhousie or 44 Scotland Street novels of Alexander McCall Smith . We can peg them pretty easily: they are the Edinburgh versions of people we might meet in Zabars. But what can we make of Lacour?

# Mencken  ’s style is a little more archaic and erudite (not dissimilar from, say,  Nassim Nicholas Taleb  --- Mencken For those familiar with the game-o-sphere, reading In Defense of Women is like getting a double whammy of Heartiste ’s philosophizing on the greater socio-sexual implications of gender dynamics and Ferdinand Bardamu ’s screeds against the general terribleness of modern American women. Of course, Mencken ’s style is a little more archaic and erudite (not dissimilar from, say, Nassim Nicholas Taleb ’s whimsically erudite style) than Heartiste’s and Bardamu’s , and more enjoyable to boot.
