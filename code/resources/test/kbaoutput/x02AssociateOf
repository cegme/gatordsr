As I believe Dan Hannan and Douglas Carswell have argued, if the Conservative Party goes into the next General Election with a firm commitment to an EU referendum, Cameron can shoot UKIP’s fox. But it will be a tough job to convince the electorate of our sincerity, after the long trail of broken promises from all major parties on referenda. To persuade voters, we may need legislation ahead of the election. In any case I doubt this will happen - Cameron , as noted above, has set his face against an in/out referendum.
