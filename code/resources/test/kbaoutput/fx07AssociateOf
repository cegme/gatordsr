Abstract. The Jaynes-Cummings ( JC ) model is a milestone in the the- ory of coherent interaction between a two-level system and a single bosonic field mode. This tutorial aims to give a complete description of the model, analyzing the Hamiltonian of the system, its eigenvalues and eigestates, in order to characterize the dynamics of system and sub- systems. The Rabi oscillations , together with the collapse and revival effects, are distinguishing features of the JC model and are important for applications in Quantum Information theory. The framework of cav- ity quantum electrodynamics ( cQED ) is chosen and two fundamental experiments on the coherent interaction between Rydberg atoms and a single cavity field mode are described. 1 Introduction The JC model was originally proposed in 1963 by Edwin Jaynes and Fred Cummings [1] in order to study the relationship between the quantum theory of radiation and the semi-classical theory in describing the phenomenon of spontaneous emission.

We bought this book at the Jack Williamson Lectureship back in April and it sat on the shelf until my husband pulled it down to read early in October. He commented on how dark it was -- something he has trouble with anymore. His biggest complaint, really was that Ian is one of the funniest people we have ever met, and it seemed like a waste of that wonderful sense of humor. He liked the book a lot, but he would have liked it more if it hadn't been so dark. When I sat down to read it, I could see what he was talking about, but it didn't bother me nearly as much. I really liked the book. Ian Tregillis is a very good writer; his descriptions were wonderful even if what he was describing was a bit gruesome ! The sequel is due out next year.

# Alexander McCall  Smith books were fun to read. The Comforts of a Muddy Saturday and The Right Attitude to Rain are both  Isabel Dalhousie  --- The Alexander McCall Smith books were fun to read. The Comforts of a Muddy Saturday and The Right Attitude to Rain are both Isabel Dalhousie novels. I had trouble getting into this series because I love his No.1 Ladies Detective Agency books and Portuguese Irregular Verbs and the others in that series. Somehow these books seemed a little less substantial. As I have read more of them, though, I have come to appreciate them for their simplicity. I like the little I learn about Scotland from reading them. These books are all about people, and Smith does an excellent job of describing human idiosyncrasies.

I like the little I learn about Scotland from reading them. These books are all about people, and Smith does an excellent job of describing human idiosyncrasies.

# Martin Donovan  , take the basic elements associated with a Hitchcock film and bring them up to date by pushing the limits to modern barriers and thereby creating more disturbing and haunting films.  In  --- Film School Essays Part Two - Apartment Zero The Place Where I Am Myself I took an amazing Film History class - one whole semester of Hitchcock taught by Tom Schatz. It was heavenly. For my term paper in that class, I chose to analyze the film "Apartment Zero" and expound on how heavily influenced it was by Hitchcock films. Before you read this entry, you might want to watch " Apartment Zero". It's available on DVD through Netflix , if you still have that service. I don't know if it's streaming anywhere, but you should see it somewhere, somehow. It 's the very first time I saw Colin Firth and he was superb. So glad that everyone else has discovered him now. Heh. Again , I will post the professor's comments at the bottom. APARTMENT ZERO: THE HITCHCOCK FILM LIVES ONMay 6, 1991There is a long list of expectations a viewer associates with the works of Alfred Hitchcock. Because of his strong (1) style that obviously appeals to audiences around the world, many directors have sought to "cash in" on the formula. Some just copy his work story for story (2) and almost shot for shot while others, such as Martin Donovan , take the basic elements associated with a Hitchcock film and bring them up to date by pushing the limits to modern barriers and thereby creating more disturbing and haunting films. In his 1988 film, Apartment Zero , Donovan has created a work that is worthy of distinction not only for its use of themes and techniques to take those elements to extremes (3) without being heavy handed in his treatment of them. The film belongs to the character of Adrian LeDuc. We , the audience, begin and end the film with him and, through him , Donovan reveals both the plot, the relationship between him and Jack Carney , and the subplot, the murders that are taking place in the city. As the film opens, Adrian is in medium close-up ( MCU ) staring out of the projection booth in his theatre, totally engrossed in watching a film. The camera stays with Adrian , giving him the close-up ( CU ) shots and point of view ( POV ) shots, until the character of Jack is introduced.In his introduction of Jack , Donovan uses the camera to marry both the viewer and Adrian to the character. Adrian opens the door of his apartment and immediately receives a POV shot of the hall. The camera then slowly zooms in on Laura over Jack 's shoulder ( OTS). When she motions that Adrian is watching, Jack turns and centers himself in a tight close-up( 4). The next shot starts out as Jack 's POV of Adrian down the hall. The camera starts moving down the hall toward Adrian's apartment and, as Jack moves slightly into frame, becomes a traveling OTS. As the two men move into the apartment, there is a reverse shot of Laura at her apartment door. The camera starts with a medium shot of her and retreats down the hall, as Jack had done only a second before. From this point until Claudia's murder (5), the characters of Jack and Adrian share the film. Neither one is more privileged by the camera in their scenes together and in scenes shared with other characters; Jack and/or Adrian dominate in terms of camera identification(6).Adrian comes back from his mother's funeral to find that Jack has murdered Claudia (7) in his own home. The two men start the sequence with equal camera time. However , as they are driving to the dump to dispose of the body, Donovan starts to give Adrian a little more privilege. We enter into Adrian 's consciousness through his on-screen memories of Claudia and we feel his anxiety through his worried glances. At one point he looks at the camera for a split second as if to apologize to us for his involvement( 8). After they throw the body into the dump, the camera stays on Adrian as he tries to cover her . By the time the two men go back to the apartment to clean up and pack for their trip to California , Donovan has given the film back to Adrian , who controls it until the end.Like in any Hitchcock film, the disclosure of information to the audience is heavily controlled by the director. Throughout the course of the film the many layers of secrets the characters have, or think that they have, are stripped away until they are left with nothing. The catalyst in all of this is the character of Jack. Through his visits to the other apartments we discover that the McKinney sisters are heavy drinkers; Carlos , the ladies' man, regards a boarding school buddy as "an unfulfilled fantasy;" Laura is dissatisfied with her marriage; Vanessa just wants love and acceptance. Once we know their secrets, they become more important to us and we can regard them as real people, not as separate, threatening entities as Adrian does.

# Martin Donovan  , take the basic elements associated with a Hitchcock film and bring them up to date by pushing the limits to modern barriers and thereby creating more disturbing and haunting films.  In  --- Film School Essays Part Two - Apartment Zero The Place Where I Am Myself I took an amazing Film History class - one whole semester of Hitchcock taught by Tom Schatz. It was heavenly. For my term paper in that class, I chose to analyze the film "Apartment Zero" and expound on how heavily influenced it was by Hitchcock films. Before you read this entry, you might want to watch " Apartment Zero". It's available on DVD through Netflix , if you still have that service. I don't know if it's streaming anywhere, but you should see it somewhere, somehow. It 's the very first time I saw Colin Firth and he was superb. So glad that everyone else has discovered him now. Heh. Again , I will post the professor's comments at the bottom. APARTMENT ZERO: THE HITCHCOCK FILM LIVES ONMay 6, 1991There is a long list of expectations a viewer associates with the works of Alfred Hitchcock. Because of his strong (1) style that obviously appeals to audiences around the world, many directors have sought to "cash in" on the formula. Some just copy his work story for story (2) and almost shot for shot while others, such as Martin Donovan , take the basic elements associated with a Hitchcock film and bring them up to date by pushing the limits to modern barriers and thereby creating more disturbing and haunting films. In his 1988 film, Apartment Zero , Donovan has created a work that is worthy of distinction not only for its use of themes and techniques to take those elements to extremes (3) without being heavy handed in his treatment of them. The film belongs to the character of Adrian LeDuc. We , the audience, begin and end the film with him and, through him , Donovan reveals both the plot, the relationship between him and Jack Carney , and the subplot, the murders that are taking place in the city. As the film opens, Adrian is in medium close-up ( MCU ) staring out of the projection booth in his theatre, totally engrossed in watching a film. The camera stays with Adrian , giving him the close-up ( CU ) shots and point of view ( POV ) shots, until the character of Jack is introduced.In his introduction of Jack , Donovan uses the camera to marry both the viewer and Adrian to the character. Adrian opens the door of his apartment and immediately receives a POV shot of the hall. The camera then slowly zooms in on Laura over Jack 's shoulder ( OTS). When she motions that Adrian is watching, Jack turns and centers himself in a tight close-up( 4). The next shot starts out as Jack 's POV of Adrian down the hall. The camera starts moving down the hall toward Adrian's apartment and, as Jack moves slightly into frame, becomes a traveling OTS. As the two men move into the apartment, there is a reverse shot of Laura at her apartment door. The camera starts with a medium shot of her and retreats down the hall, as Jack had done only a second before. From this point until Claudia's murder (5), the characters of Jack and Adrian share the film. Neither one is more privileged by the camera in their scenes together and in scenes shared with other characters; Jack and/or Adrian dominate in terms of camera identification(6).Adrian comes back from his mother's funeral to find that Jack has murdered Claudia (7) in his own home. The two men start the sequence with equal camera time. However , as they are driving to the dump to dispose of the body, Donovan starts to give Adrian a little more privilege. We enter into Adrian 's consciousness through his on-screen memories of Claudia and we feel his anxiety through his worried glances. At one point he looks at the camera for a split second as if to apologize to us for his involvement( 8). After they throw the body into the dump, the camera stays on Adrian as he tries to cover her . By the time the two men go back to the apartment to clean up and pack for their trip to California , Donovan has given the film back to Adrian , who controls it until the end.Like in any Hitchcock film, the disclosure of information to the audience is heavily controlled by the director. Throughout the course of the film the many layers of secrets the characters have, or think that they have, are stripped away until they are left with nothing. The catalyst in all of this is the character of Jack. Through his visits to the other apartments we discover that the McKinney sisters are heavy drinkers; Carlos , the ladies' man, regards a boarding school buddy as "an unfulfilled fantasy;" Laura is dissatisfied with her marriage; Vanessa just wants love and acceptance. Once we know their secrets, they become more important to us and we can regard them as real people, not as separate, threatening entities as Adrian does.

# Fossil  fuels are made of dead plants and animals. Some examples of fossil fuels are oil and petroleum.

(A producer is something that makes food for other animals through photosynthesis, like grass.) This floating green algae is food to many consumers in the ocean. (A consumer is something that eats the producers. ) One kind of a consumer is small fish. There are many others like crabs, some whales, and many other animals. Fewer algae is a problem because there is less food for us and many animals in the sea. Global warming is doing many things to people as well as animals and plants. It is killing algae, but it is also destroying many huge forests. The pollution that causes global warming is linked to acid rain. Acid rain gradually destroys almost everything it touches. Global warming is also causing many more fires that wipe out whole forests. This happens because global warming can make the earth very hot. In forests, some plants and trees leaves can be so dry that they catch on fire. What causes global warming? Many things cause global warming. One thing that causes global warming is electrical pollution. Electricity causes pollution in many ways, some worse than others. In most cases, fossil fuels are burned to create electricity. Fossil fuels are made of dead plants and animals. Some examples of fossil fuels are oil and petroleum. Many pollutants (chemicals that pollute the air, water, and land) are sent into the air when fossil fuels are burned. Some of these chemicals are called greenhouse gasses.
