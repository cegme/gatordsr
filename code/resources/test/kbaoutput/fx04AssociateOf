# Hofstadter  writes: The basic elements of contemporary right-wing thought can be reduced to three: First, there has been the now-familiar sustained conspiracy, running over more than a generation, and reaching its climax in  Roosevelt  --- In more recent times, such ideas were replaced by McCarthyism and the notion that the United Nations was a front for international communism. Hofstadter writes: The basic elements of contemporary right-wing thought can be reduced to three: First, there has been the now-familiar sustained conspiracy, running over more than a generation, and reaching its climax in Roosevelt ’s New Deal , to undermine free capitalism, to bring the economy under the direction of the federal government, and to pave the way for socialism or communism.... The second contention is that top government officialdom has been so infiltrated by Communists that American policy... has been dominated by men who were shrewdly and consistently selling out American national interests.

I  --- RE: ~October Pagan Parents Circle~ LIONESS - SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bibble bibble bounce bounce w00t ! ! !!!!!!!! Happy dance ! :) Sorry you feel like ick though. Maia - Hugs sweetie, I'm so sorry. Hang in there and do what you have to do to keep /yourself/ healthy, safe, and sane. DoK - how you feeling today? Any better? Salt water gargles maybe? Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes. Hmmmm .... that year dd2 was a "chicken fairy princess" so her costume was pretty easy... a princess dress from the costume box and a whole bunch of chicken feathers in her hair/tied to her dress/on her shoes. No one had a clue what she was, but she loved it! Let me think. Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

Growing up I was the Goddess Diana ( tin foil crescent moon attached to a headband, white sheet "toga" over white long johns), my brother was a "snow ninja" (white long johns, white karate outfit from thrift store, white bandages wrapping foot to knee/elbow to wrist) and the following year a mummy using the same basic parts, I was Little Bo Peep once with a poofy dress and a cardboard shepherd's crook, a rainbow (colored scarves tied to my arms and around my waist and in my hair), a tossed salad (I was a toddler, apparently I wore green and my parents attached felt food with safety pins), a trash fairy or Vampire Hunter D or Morticia Addams or Spawn look (in college, cut a black garbage bag into two inch wide strips, attach strips to duct tape at one end and wrap duct tape around waist to creat a "hula skirt" sort of thing and wear over a body suit with wings or with a hat or whatever... the plastic strips get charged with static and "reach out" to grab stuff...it's much fun ! ), my brother was a knight in cardboard and tin foil armor, Harpo Marx (long white lab coat, bowler hat, bike horn), mad scientist (same lab coat, different props), etc. I think homemade costumes, or rather parent made costumes, work pretty well for younger kids... once kiddos are older though I think either they need to make the costume themselves (which is what I did growing up after the age of about 10) or they'll be happier with store bought so they'll match their peer group. Health - sick like unto the proverbial dog. :( This is my second cold since Tiel was born and it's a doozy. It 's not mastitis, and I'm doing what I can to keep it that way, but I'm wiped out. Last night Tiel decided she would sleep from 10:30pm-1:30am and then she 'd only sleep if I held her upright and bounced her . So there I am, feverish , sick, and bouncing in the dark. Any time I'd put her down she 'd start fussing and then wake all the way up and want to nurse. But she nursed so much she started "spilling" so I ended up changing her outfit twice, my jammies twice, and the sheets once. And right now my hair is nasty with partially processed post-baby breastmilk. Ugh. I feel like crud and look it too. I told dh that this coming weekend I don't care which child we have to sell.... I want pants that fit, a hair cut that looks good, and glasses that are not held together with super glue/tape (since they're giving me massive headaches I think new glasses fall into "must" rather than "want"). Of course, what I wanted was for him to offer these things this weekend since it's Tiel 's one month anniversary and he actually TOLD me he was going to do something special. But then he "ran out of time" to do whatever it was he thought he was going to do, and I got sick and didn't feel like dragging myself to the thrift store with four small kiddos in tow while he mowed the yard. Sooooooo. It didn't happen. But dear lords and ladies of light I no longer care... if I am going to be totally "sleep free" and filled with ouch (fever of 100 /with/ the meds, hypersensitive to cold/touch, congested, lymph nodes the size of golf balls in my jaw and neck, etc), and coered with spit up.... I want to at least pretend I'm sparkly and spiffy and on top of stuff you know? LOL Menu planning- since we're having a budget crunch thanks to the new babe/medical bills I planned out a menu and shopping list. Since I was so sick dh offered to go get the shopping and take the three bigger kids (on sat). I wrote the list, including brands/sizes, and in the order you'd reach the item in the store. I highlinghted 4 things he could put back if the total was going to be above 100 dollars (since I wasn't sure of price on a few things) and reminded him a couple times of our budget. And you guessed it... he spent 136 dollars and yet didn't actually have all the items on the list. In fact, he forgot to get several pretty crucial items (fruit for lunches and snacks, corn cakes to make sandwiches , gfree flour to use in a few dinner recipes, taco shells which were the basis for two meals). And the thing was... he was so proud! He had compared unit prices and purchased two small jars of peanut butter instead of one large jar since the unit price was better (though without corn cakes and/or flour I can't make anything to put the pb on , we don't have shelf space for two jars, and despite the better unit price it still cost more total since he bought two instead of one) and spent 20 dollars on a roast since the per lb price was good (though still more per lb than the ground beef I'd put on the list and obviously /not/ going to work as a taco filling, burger meal, or meatloaf... so there go three dinners! ). Sigh. And HE was the one who really freaked out about the budget last week. Obviously he can't do the shopping, even with a super detailed list, and that's fine. I 'm trying to figure out meal ideas to use what he did get, thankfully we have carrots/kix/raisins so the kids can eat veggies or "trail mix" instead of apples for snacks, and we have plenty of eggs! I think my next attempt at a grocery/menu adventure will be to take the babe and leave the big kids with dh. If only I'm not feverish! LOL sniffle LOL hack hack cough Reply Reply

Maia - Hugs sweetie, I'm so sorry. Hang in there and do what you have to do to keep /yourself/ healthy, safe, and sane. DoK - how you feeling today? Any better? Salt water gargles maybe? Hope you're at least pain free soon! costumes- I love those "jacket" style costumes (the kind where the costum is put on with a front zipper, or pulled on over the head like a vest?) since they're so darn easy to get into (since the kiddos can't ride in their costumes and trick or treating around here requires a car so costumes that are easy on/easy offare a must if they're any bulkier than "normal clothes"). But we usually end up making a few costumes too. I usually ask the kiddos to describe the costume they want and then distill that into it's basic elements. So for instance, one year dd1 wanted to be a peacock... so we went to the thrift store, got a huge turquoise shirt and blue pants, braided her hair and stuck some peacock feathers in it (from the craft store ). We figured out how to make a tail too (sort of a fan of feathers attached to a belt) that she wore at her costume party but decide against wearing on the actual night. Another year I made a dinosaur costume... green pants, green shirt, and a "dino hat" made out of a sheet of green bendy foam from the craft store. The hat was basically a triangle... white cardboard teeth were glued to the indside of the "mouth end", googly eyes glued to the appropriate spots, and the whole thing tied with a shoelace under dd1 's chin. Oh , and she insisted on "claws" on her feet ( she was a velociraptor of course) so I made those out of leftover green foam and ducttaped them to her shoes.

# Aharon Barak Clique  ," because all of its members are groupies and followers of the previous Chief Justice,  Barak.  --- The leftwing Neo-Nazi web magazine Counterpunch has described Plaut thus: "One of the most pernicious writers is Steven Plaut , a ma The Supreme Need to Fix the Israeli Supreme Court For years I have been claiming that Israel has a politicized dual justice system, where one set of rules operates for leftists and another for everyone else. For years I have been insisting that the Prosecution or Attorney General's Office in Israel is partisan and politicized and biased. I of course have not been the only person saying such things. But now such accusations carry new weight because very similar comments to my own are being made this week by … (drumroll) … Israel 's Minister of Justice , Yaakov Neeman. Neeman is lashing out against the Attorney General for the latter's bias and arbitrary partisanship in prosecution. See this report: http://www.haaretz .com/print-edition/news/sources-israeli-justice-minister-accuses-state-prosecutor-of-indicting-too-quickly-1.405502 But Neeman is going further than that. To explain what he has been doing, you need to understand the structure of Israel 's judicial system. For many years it has been subordinated to the anti-democratic doctrines of "judicial activism" promoted by the radical Left. This doctrine holds that leftist judges should be allowed to dictate governmental policy in all things, and just make up the rules and laws as they go along, in ways that appeal to the Left. Israeli anti-democratic judges insist that non-elected judges have the right to dictate decisions to the elected representatives of the people, to overturn and veto laws passed by the representatives of the people, and simply to invent imaginary mandates and "rights" that must be upheld, even when the parliament refuses to approve them. These days, the cult of judicial tyranny is known as the "Beinisch Clique," named after the current leftist Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court , Dorit Beinisch. She has never hidden her leftist political agenda nor her devotion to "judicial activism." However the more proper name for this cult of anti-democratic judicial tyranny is the " Aharon Barak Clique ," because all of its members are groupies and followers of the previous Chief Justice, Barak. Israeli judges are selected by a panel or commission for the selection of judges, in which sitting judges are the dominant force and the majority of the panel. So , in effect, the unelected judicial elite gets to perpetuate its powers of control over the judiciary by selecting other new judges who toe its ideological line. And the appointees cannot be impeached and removed, except by the same panel (and it never does so). This is why the Far Left has continued to control Israel's Supreme Court and many of its other courts even during the decades in which the Likud and the "Right" were nominally in power. There have been initiatives in the past few weeks to change that. First , a law was just passed that cancels the requirement that the Chief Justice must be a sitting Supreme Court judge for at least three years. The proposal was designed to allow Judge Asher Gronis to serve as Chief Justice. Known as the "Gronis bill," it serves to revoke the three-year requirement that was passed by a previous government as part of ITS own Byzantine machinations to block someone else from being Chief Justice at that time. Gronis is an intelligent and moderate person (ideologically) who rejects judicial activism. And that is why the Left is hysterical over the " Gronis Bill ," claiming it is a fascist assault against democracy. In reality, what really has them upset is that the hegemony of the Far Left over the court will be weakened with Gronis as Chief Justice. This is "anti-democratic" only if you believe the government elected by the people of Israel should never undo or challenge the leftist hegemony over the court being exercised by those NOT elected by the people of Israel. In addition, a bill stands before the Knesset that would change the composition of the panel that selects the judges, increasing the weight of the non-leftists there. In particular it would appoint two more reps who explicitly reject the judicial activism of the Left and who are NOT associated with the Beinisch Clique, which until now has dominated the panel. But there is now a new problem. Every time the Likud is in a position to exercise some power as the elected government and to challenge the hegemony of the Left, Bibi Netanyahu gets a bad case of frigid feet and spaghetti vertebrae. Netanyahu 's legacy as Prime Minister will best be remembered as one of cowardice and capitulation. Bibi thinks that if he vetoes and blocks every single initiative by the Right to rein in the Left, then the leftist media will like him and pander to him . Netanyahu 's first fete of cowardice was when he failed to re-appoint Prof. Daniel Friedmann to a new term as Minister of Justice. Friedmann had been leading the charge against judicial activism under the previous government. Later Netanyahu vetoed at the last minute the initiative to require transparency with regard to the foreign funding of hostile anti- Israel extremist NGOs operating in Israel . And now he has just come out AGAINST the initiative to change the composition of the panel for selection of judges. Ending the hegemony of the Left and of the unelected anti-democratic Beinisch Clique over the selection of judges is suddenly "undemocratic," opines Netanyahu. The irony, of course, is that the countless displays of cowardice by Bibi never gain him any sympathy from the leftist-controlled media, which continue to demonize him and crusade against the Likud. Meanwhile, Neeman is getting more and more outspoken about other things as well, just as Bibi gets more and more pusillanimous.

Known as the "Gronis bill," it serves to revoke the three-year requirement that was passed by a previous government as part of ITS own Byzantine machinations to block someone else from being Chief Justice at that time. Gronis is an intelligent and moderate person (ideologically) who rejects judicial activism. And that is why the Left is hysterical over the " Gronis Bill ," claiming it is a fascist assault against democracy. In reality, what really has them upset is that the hegemony of the Far Left over the court will be weakened with Gronis as Chief Justice. This is "anti-democratic" only if you believe the government elected by the people of Israel should never undo or challenge the leftist hegemony over the court being exercised by those NOT elected by the people of Israel. In addition, a bill stands before the Knesset that would change the composition of the panel that selects the judges, increasing the weight of the non-leftists there. In particular it would appoint two more reps who explicitly reject the judicial activism of the Left and who are NOT associated with the Beinisch Clique, which until now has dominated the panel. But there is now a new problem. Every time the Likud is in a position to exercise some power as the elected government and to challenge the hegemony of the Left, Bibi Netanyahu gets a bad case of frigid feet and spaghetti vertebrae. Netanyahu 's legacy as Prime Minister will best be remembered as one of cowardice and capitulation. Bibi thinks that if he vetoes and blocks every single initiative by the Right to rein in the Left, then the leftist media will like him and pander to him . Netanyahu 's first fete of cowardice was when he failed to re-appoint Prof. Daniel Friedmann to a new term as Minister of Justice. Friedmann had been leading the charge against judicial activism under the previous government. Later Netanyahu vetoed at the last minute the initiative to require transparency with regard to the foreign funding of hostile anti- Israel extremist NGOs operating in Israel . And now he has just come out AGAINST the initiative to change the composition of the panel for selection of judges. Ending the hegemony of the Left and of the unelected anti-democratic Beinisch Clique over the selection of judges is suddenly "undemocratic," opines Netanyahu. The irony, of course, is that the countless displays of cowardice by Bibi never gain him any sympathy from the leftist-controlled media, which continue to demonize him and crusade against the Likud. Meanwhile, Neeman is getting more and more outspoken about other things as well, just as Bibi gets more and more pusillanimous.
