# Fire  was critical because I needed to boil water to make it drinkable, cook my food and provide warmth, both physically and mentally –  I  --- For example: fire. Fire was critical because I needed to boil water to make it drinkable, cook my food and provide warmth, both physically and mentally – I now know what is meant by the phrase ‘the fire is your friend’ . However, I came to regard my relationship with the fire as stronger than that: the fire was my baby. This is because keeping a fire going took a lot of energy and effort as I was constantly tending and caring for it. During the day, I never left if for more than half an hour for fear of it going out so I was restricted as to the sort of activities I could enjoy. Not only was I always close by, but I would spend about six hours a day finding and collecting wood; sawing and chopping it and drying it when necessary. The more time I spend with it, the more aware I became of its subtleties – how it reacted to wind, to rain, to certain types of wood. I came to know what sort of wood I needed to put on the fire and in what way in order to create the intense heat needed for boiling water. Similarly, I learnt what I needed to do to dampen it down so it would burn slowly. During the night I trained myself to always check it when I woke – 5 or 6 times a night – so it wouldn’t go out. I became very adept at being able to get it going from the faintest of embers. I feel I came to ‘know’ the fire and what it needed and when.

# William Cohen  and former Canadian Prime Minister  Brian Mulroney  --- Tweet Author: Steve Paikin Monday June 20, 2011 The Munk Debate has turned into perhaps THE Canadian big-name event for serious, intelligent, and free-wheeling debate on a major topic of the day. It started in the Royal Ontario Museum before several hundred people, but has since moved to Roy Thomson Hall , where 2700 spectators can take it in, not to mention millions more through television, radio, and internet partnerships. With Peter Munk 's sponsorship and Rudyard Griffiths ' organization and moderation, the Munk Debate has grown into something quite special. Audience members on this night included former American Defense Secretary William Cohen and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney . Rudyard Griffiths opens the Munk Debate last Friday at Thomson Hall in Toronto . Last Friday night, it hit a new high in its debate over whether the 21st century would belong to China . Arguing yes: Niall Ferguson and David Li. Arguing no: Fareed Zakaria , and none other than 88-year-old Henry Kissinger , who in all his years in the public eye, has never participated in an open debate of this kind before. The "No" Team: Henry Kissinger and Fareed Zakaria. The first thing that surprised me about the debate were the lack of protestors outside.

With Peter Munk 's sponsorship and Rudyard Griffiths ' organization and moderation, the Munk Debate has grown into something quite special. Audience members on this night included former American Defense Secretary William Cohen and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney . Rudyard Griffiths opens the Munk Debate last Friday at Thomson Hall in Toronto . Last Friday night, it hit a new high in its debate over whether the 21st century would belong to China . Arguing yes: Niall Ferguson and David Li. Arguing no: Fareed Zakaria , and none other than 88-year-old Henry Kissinger , who in all his years in the public eye, has never participated in an open debate of this kind before. The "No" Team: Henry Kissinger and Fareed Zakaria. The first thing that surprised me about the debate were the lack of protestors outside.

There will be rules of transparency for funding of political parties and a new electoral system to break through dependencies. There will be an amendment to the constitution in the future after substantial dialogue. We will step up efforts to mete out justice because this is one of the basic elements that citizens are fighting for today and for which they feel hard done by. We will also intensify stamping out tax evasion and achieve tangible results. We have two years ahead of us, dear colleagues, with these major priorities. This is the road to changing crisis into opportunity and to make good use of last week's agreement so as to achieve a much better Greece.

# Ruth Rendell  recently, and I suspect that this is the last of her current work that I'll read.  Past Barbara  --- I read good reviews of Ruth Rendell 's The Vault, which follows on from a novel she wrote years ago under her pen name Barbara Vine : A Sight for Sore Eyes. I had read the latter, but a long time since, and so I read both together. I enjoyed the Vine again, but was rather disappointed with the new novel. I have been going off Ruth Rendell recently, and I suspect that this is the last of her current work that I'll read. Past Barbara Vine titles, however, are usually worth reading as psychological thrillers.

# Thus  , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on.

P  --- 1 1 0 2 v o N 9 2 ] I A . s c [ 1 v 3 8 8 6 . 1 1 1 1 : v i X r a 1 Introduction and Background The integration of Logic Programming and Defeasible Reasoning has produced sev- eral Knowledge Representation and Reasoning tools ( Garc´ıa et al. 2009). Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases.

In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases.

An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P .

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument.

A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α.

The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules.

However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant.

As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability.

It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery.

An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well.

Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law.

Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation.

An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state.

The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P .

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

(An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases.

Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here.

The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a.

This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004).

These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery.

The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies.

A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law.

Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation.

The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state.

In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument).

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

(An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases.

Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α.

The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”.

Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge.

Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a.

This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims.

These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery.

An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well.

A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules.

P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law.

Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation.

An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state.

The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P .

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

(An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases.

Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here.

The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a.

This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004).

These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery.

The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies.

A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law.

Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation.

The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state.

In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument).

Among them, Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004) has been extensively studied and developed in several applications like ( Rotstein et al. 2007; Garc´ıa et al. 2007; Chesnevar et al. 2007; Thimm and Kern -Isberner 2008; Black and Hunter 2009; G´omez et al. 2010), among others. DeLP combines an extended Logic Program- ming representation language with a dialectical procedure applied to the relevant arguments to obtain the supported conclusions (see Section 3.2). By choosing DeLP as our formalism, we follow a defeasible form of reasoning 1 To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ( TPLP). 2 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari over potentially inconsistent knowledge bases ( KBs ). Here , the notion of warrant in argumentation plays the role of the consequence relation: the warranting process evaluates conflicting pieces of knowledge deciding which ones prevail despite the existence of beliefs in opposition. A warrant is also identified as the argument’ s ac- ceptance criterion corresponding to the adopted argumentative semantics. Among the most influential works on argumentation semantics, we may refer to those over graphs of arguments (Dung 1995), and more recently ( Baroni and Giacomin 2007). However, the argumentation semantics we adopt follows the idea of dialectical argu- mentation ( Prakken and Vreeswijk 2000; Chesnevar et al. 2000): arguments trees, namely dialectical trees, are built from the argumentation framework with nodes as arguments and edges as attacks, which stand for sources of inconsistency obtained from the KB. The use of dialectical trees allows to concentrate only on a specific query to build “on demand” only those arguments that are somehow related to the query. This kind of semantics allows to construct practical approaches, avoiding the analysis of the complete graph of arguments. Belief revision ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985; Hansson 1999) studies the dynamics of knowledge, coping with the problem of how to change the information standing for the conceptualization of a modeled world, to reflect its evolution. Revisions, as the most important change operations, concentrate on the incorporation of new beliefs and their interaction with older ones. A basic set of postulates is usually specified to characterize a rational behavior of the proposed change operations. Among them, minimal change and success have concentrated much research. Success specifies the main ob jective of the change operation (in the case of revisions, the inference of the new belief to incorporate). On the other hand, minimal change ensures that the least possible amount of information is modified in order to achieve success. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) ( Rotstein et al. 2008) applies belief revision concepts to the field of abstract argumentation (Dung 1995). (In abstract argu- mentation, the logic for arguments and their inner structure is abstracted away.) The main contribution provided by ATC is a revision operator at argument level that revises a theory by an argument seeking for its warrant. To such end, the theory –and thus the set of arguments obtained from it– is modified in order to guarantee success: the new argument should be accepted by the argumentation se- mantics. Consequently, different criteria of minimal change should be considered to guarantee a rational behavior of the operator proposed. Among the most rele- vant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, judicial contexts in law, and more. In this article we apply ATC to handle KBs ’ dynamics. More specifically, we rely on ATC to make evolve potentially inconsistent KBs without consistency restora- tion. To such end, we reify the abstract theory of ATC into a particular sort of KBs : defeasible logic programs ( de.l.p. s), which are managed by the Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) formalism2( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). DeLP is a rule- based argumentation formalism in which arguments are built from a subset of rules 2 The DeLP interpreter is available online at http://lidia.cs.uns. edu.ar/delp client Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 3 to infer claims. A preliminary approach on the matter of revising de. l.p. s through ATC was introduced in ( Moguillansky et al. 2008). The definition of a revision operator over a KB within the classic theory of belief revision usually involves the removal of beliefs from the KB in such a way that a new belief could be consistently incorporated afterwards. Consequently, the new belief ends up inferred by the resulting KB in a consistent manner. In some cases it is nec- essary to reverse the order in which the revision operator is defined (Hansson 1993). That is, the new belief is incorporated possibly introducing an inconsistent inter- mediate state to the KB , restoring the consistency afterwards by a series of belief removals. Such reversion is used to define the ATC ’s argument revision. This is necessary, given that in order to pursue warrant of the new argument, its inter- action with other arguments from the worked argumentation system needs to be analyzed. Thus , we first incorporate the new argument into the worked set of ar- guments. However, we are not concerned about the appearance of an intermediate inconsistent state – as is the case in classic belief revision– but on an intermediate state in which the acceptance of the new argument is not provided. In such a case, ATC provides the necessary elements to change the theory to finally accept the new argument. Analogously to the usual definition of a revision operator, in which a belief is added to the KB , in the argumentative model of change that we propose, a belief is added to a de. l. p. along with the argument that supports it. (An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.

(An argument is said to support a belief, namely the claim, by considering a minimal set of beliefs inferring it.) In order to accept the new belief by the argumentation semantics, we pursue warrant of the argument supporting such belief. In consequence, the revision theory proposes additional modifications to the program (if necessary) altering the set of arguments that originally interfered with the warrant of the new argument. The theory of change here proposed is inspired from the AGM model ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985). Due to the usage of argumentation as the base formalism, ATC has to deal with ad- ditional, inherent complications arising from the interaction of arguments through- out the warrant process. Chained removal of arguments and undesirable side effects bring about even more difficulty. Moreover , considering warrant as a notion of con- sequence, ATC also has to take into account non-monotonicity, which is not present when revision is performed over classical logic. Throughout the paper it will be clear that this fact implies a greater amount of theoretical elements, hence the conceptual and notational difficulty is consequently increased. This article provides a practical approach towards implementing ATC through DeLP. To this end, a prolog-like algorithm is given, which manipulates rules from a de. l. p. following ATC definitions. The reader should be aware that this article does not pursue a full formalization according to the classical theory of belief revision. Thus , no representation theorems are to be defined here. Instead, we look at the process of change from the argumentation standpoint taking into account the usual principles of minimal change and success. The full axiomatic characterization of ATC exceeds the scope of this article, however, the interested reader could refer to ( Moguillansky et al. 2011) for ATC ’s full characterization applied for handling dynamics of knowledge/arguments in propositional bases/argumentation. 4 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa , Garc´ıa and Simari This article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses some real examples in which ATC may bring an novel alternative to handle dynamics of knowledge in inconsistent bases. Section 3 introduces the necessary background upon which our theory relies. Section 3.1, gives a very brief intuition about belief revision, and Sec- tion 3.2 describes in a slightly deeper way the DeLP formalism. Section 4 provides a detailed study on the adopted argumentation semantics, i.e. , dialectical trees, and their characteristics regarding non-acceptance (rejection) of arguments. Section 5 details the complete ATC theory concentrating on its basic elements (Sect. 5.1), identifying the portions of dialectical trees to be changed and putting particular attention on the minimal change principle (Sect. 5.2 and Sect. 5.3), and providing the argument change operators (Sect. 5.4). In Section 6, some algorithms are given towards a full implementation of this theory upon DeLP. Related work is discussed in Section 7, and finally, Section 8 points out some final remarks. 2 Motivation Dealing with inconsistencies is of utmost importance in areas like medicine and law. For instance, in law trials, two parties to a dispute present contradictory information in a tribunal, standing in favor or against the dispute (in criminal trials this is normally the presumption of innocence). The tribunal decision resolves afterwards the dispute upon presented evidence. This shows the need to consider some kind of paraconsistent semantics in order to appropriately reason over KBs containing contradictory information. For some settings, it will be also necessary to provide services for handling dy- namics of knowledge with capabilities to tolerate inconsistencies from the KB under consideration. An interesting one arises in promulgation of laws. This usually in- volves a long process in which articles and principles from previous laws, and even evidence taken from the current state of affairs, may enter in conflict with articles composing the new law. Imagine a base containing knowledge about the complete legal system of a nation, including the National Constitution , the international law, and other political fundamental principles –such as the civil and penal codes, and other minor local laws. Such KB is required to evolve in a way that it incorporates the information conforming the new law, ensuring it to be constitutional. To this end, it is necessary to identify a set of articles and/or principles to be derogated, or amended, as part of the process of promulgation. As an example, we will refer in a very brief manner to the Argentinean broadcast- ing media law reformed during 2009. The previous media law, promulgated by the latter de facto regime, empowered the government to regulate the different media allowing total control of news. When democracy was restituted, the regulation of media was extended to private investment groups. As years went by, these groups took over ma jorities of types of media, conforming monopolies in some cases. This brought excessive power to groups with partial interests, allowing them to ma- nipulate the social opinion about the actual government, and even to condition politicians, thus striking to national sovereignty. Article 161 of the new media law became one of the most controversial points, since it forces monopolistic enterprises Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 5 to get rid of part of their assets in a maximum period of one year. Some enterprises warned that they would be forced to sell off their assets at very low prices. This violates article 17 of the National Constitution which speaks about private prop- erty rights. Moreover , some members of the Supreme Court think that article 161 recalls the control over the media exercised by totalitarian regimes, which would violate article 1 of the National Constitution. In fact, such situation could evolve to a distrust state on the principle of legal security. These are just some of the contro- versial points for which the new media law keeps being studied by the Argentinean parliament at the time of this submission. Belief revision studies the dynamics of knowledge relying upon consistency restora- tion. That is, change is applied through change operations like revisions, by ensuring a consistent resulting base. Observe however, that for the aforementioned case of promulgation of laws, it is mandatory to keep most inconsistencies from the original KB to make it evolve appropriately. This led us to investigate new approaches of belief revision which operate over paraconsistent semantics in order to avoid con- sistency restoration. Argument Theory Change ( ATC ) arises with such ob jective, applying belief revision to argumentation systems. Among the most relevant uses of ATC , we may refer to hypothetical reasoning, dynamics in negotiation, persuasion, dialogues, strategies, planning, and more. For instance, in scheduling, consider the development of a company’s task scheduler. Assume employee assignments are managed by an agent interpreting a KB . The central authority incorporates new tasks to the KB. An agent uses this information to decide to which employees should the new requirements be assigned. Argumen- tation could deal with such a problem since it would be necessary to reason over inconsistency: conflicts would appear between the relevance of tasks and employees availability. A new task with a high level of relevance could be sent to a specific employee for a matter of trust, provoking the reallocation of his previous tasks to other employees. ATC can be useful to implement the re-scheduling process by recognizing how new assignments are in conflict with preexisting ones. It is important to mention that, unlike typical KB revision models in which a base is revised by a sentence, here we are concerned with the operation of revising a de. l. p. by a given argument. This could be a good alternative to revise a KB by a piece of information of higher conceptual complexity. For instance, considering the example given before on promulgation of laws, an ATC model could revise the legal system by including an argument standing for the new law to be promulgated. In this case, arguments to be removed from the original argumentation system would contain different articles from preexisting laws. Thus , the new law is ensured to be constitutional by proposing to derogate other laws or amend them by removing specific articles which are part of arguments to be removed. Naturally, removals from the base are expected to be of less importance than the one for the new law. That is, laws to be amended should never correspond to the National Constitution unless the promulgation of the new law is expected to reform it. In case no minor laws arise to be amended, it is clear that the new one cannot be included as it is and thus, it necessarily needs to be modified to be accepted by the legal system. 6 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari 3 Overviews In this section we give an overview of the necessary theoretical background for the ATC machinery. Firstly some elements of the classic belief revision theory are introduced, and afterwards we present the main definitions of DeLP . 3.1 Belief Revision Overview Belief revision studies the process of changing beliefs from an epistemic state to accept new information. An epistemic state –to which change operations are applicable– accounts for knowledge in the form of either a belief base or a belief set. A belief base (know ledge base ) is an epistemic state represented by a set of sentences not necessarily closed under logical consequence. On the other hand, a belief set is a set of sentences closed under logical consequence. In general, a belief set is infinite, being this the main reason of the impossibility to deal with this kind of sets in a computer. Instead, it is possible to characterize the properties that each change operation should satisfy on any finite representation of an epistemic state. The classic change operations as seen in the AGM model of theory change ( Alchourr ´on et al. 1985) –named after their proponents Alchourr ´on , Gardenfors , and Makinson – are known as expansions, contractions, and revisions. An expansion incorporates a new belief without guaranteeing a consistent resulting epistemic state. A contraction eliminates a belief α , and other beliefs making possible its inference, from the epistemic state. Finally, a revision adds a new belief α to the epistemic state guaranteeing a consistent outcome always that α is consistent as well. This means that the revision includes a new belief and possibly eliminates others in order to avoid inconsistencies. Revisions are usually defined by means of contractions and expansions: assuming a revision operator “ ∗” , a new belief α , and an epistemic state K ; the resulting epistemic state K ∗ α is ensured to be consistent (unless α is inconsistent) through a contraction “ − ” by the complement of the new belief ( i.e. , ∼α ) and an expansion “ + ” by α. If the epistemic state does not imply ∼ α , then α can be incorporated without loss of consistency. This composition of sub-operations defines a revision operator through the Levi identity: K ∗ α = (K − ∼α) + α (Levi 1977; Gardenfors 1981). In (Hansson 1993) the reverse of this identity was studied. This will be helpful for the definition of the model of change proposed here. The changes applied to the epistemic state might conform to the minimal change principle. This notion is one of the rationality principles of change. Furthermore , these principles are formalized through a set of rationality postulates which are used to guarantee that a change operation behaves in a rational manner. In this paper we concentrate on the specification of the model of change, and only two principles will be taken into account: minimal change and success –a successful revision operation refers to the primacy of new information. The AGM model of change specifies an array of theoretical tools to perform revision over belief sets. Nonetheless, since in this work we aim at performing change over defeasible logic programs –which can be seen as a kind of belief bases – Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 7 we preferred to rely on Hansson’s kernel sets (Hansson 1994) which were pro- posed to deal with practical approaches. A kernel set is a minimal set of beliefs inferring α (namely, an α-kernel ) from the epistemic state. The kernel contrac- tion (Hansson 1994) –applicable both to belief bases and belief sets– specifies an operator capable of selecting and eliminating beliefs from each α-kernel in K , in order to avoid inferring α. The relation between the notions of kernel sets and arguments will be clear in the following section. 3.2 Defeasible Logic Programming Overview Defeasible Logic Programming ( DeLP ) combines results of logic programming and defeasible argumentation. A brief description of DeLP is included below –for a detailed presentation see ( Garc´ıa and Simari 2004). A defeasible logic program (or de. l. p. for short) is a finite set of facts, strict rules and defeasible rules. Facts are ground literals representing atomic information or the negation of atomic informa- tion using the strong negation “ ∼”. Strict rules represent non-defeasible informa- tion noted as β0 ← β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. Defeasible rules represent tentative information noted as β0 –≺ β1 , . . . , βn , where βi for i ≥ 0 is a ground literal. The particular case of a defeasible rule with empty body is called a presumption. A query is a ground literal that can be posed to a de. l. p. to find out whether it is warranted. The domain of all defeasible rules is denoted as Ld , and that containing all the strict rules and facts, as Ls . When required, a de. l.p. P is denoted ( Π , ∆ ), distinguishing the subset Π of facts and strict rules, and the subset ∆ of defeasible rules (see Example 1), however, such a distinction is not mandatory for representing de. l.p.s , being also correct the use of a common set of facts, strict rules, and defeasible rules. Example 1 Consider the de. l.p. P 1 = ( Π1 , ∆1 ): (p ← t ) (cid:27) ∆ 1=  (∼a –≺ y ), ( y –≺ x ), ( x –≺ z ), Π1 = (cid:26) t, z , ( y –≺ p ), (a –≺ w), ( w –≺ y ), (∼ w –≺ t ), ( ∼x –≺ t ), ( x –≺ p )   In DeLP , literals can be derived from rules and facts, being a defeasible derivation one that uses, at least, a single defeasible rule; and a strict derivation one that only uses strict rules or facts. Strong negation is allowed in the head of program rules, and hence may be used to represent contradictory knowledge. We say that two literals are contradictory if they are complementary with respect to strong negation ( e.g. , a and ∼a ). Hence , a set of rules and facts is contradictory if two contradictory literals can be derived from it. It is important to note that the set Π (which is used to represent non-defeasible information) must possess certain internal coherence, and therefore, Π must be a non-contradictory set. However, from a program ( Π , ∆ ), contradictory literals could be derived by using both kinds of rules, e.g. , from ( Π1 , ∆1 ) of Example 1 it is possible to defeasibly derive a and ∼ a. DeLP incorporates an argumentation formalism for the treatment of contradic- tory knowledge that can be defeasibly derived. This formalism allows the identifica- 8 Moguil lansky , Rotstein , Falappa, Garc´ıa and Simari tion of contradictory pieces of knowledge, where a dialectical process decides which information prevails as warranted. This dialectical process involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. From a de. l.p. P = ( Π , ∆ ), an argument hA, αi is conformed by a minimal set A ⊆ ∆ of defeasible rules that, along with the set Π of strict rules and facts from P , is not contradictory and derives a certain conclusion α. Definition 1 (Argument Structure) Let P = ( Π , ∆ ) be a de. l.p. , hA , αi is an argument structure for a ground literal α from P , if A is a minimal set of defeasible rules ( A ⊆ ∆ ) such that: 1. there exists a derivation for α from Π ∪ A , and 2. the set Π ∪ A is non-contradictory. The domain of al l argument structures from P is denoted ArgsP . If hA , αi is an argument structure we wil l also say that A is an argument, and that A supports α. Example 2 From P 1 in Example 1, we can build the fol lowing arguments: hB1 , ∼ ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ x , x –≺ z }, ∼ ai hB2 , ∼ai = h{∼a –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ∼ ai hB3 , ai = h{a –≺ w , w –≺ y , y –≺ p}, ai hB4 , ∼ wi = h{∼w –≺ t}, ∼wi hB5 , ∼xi = h{∼x –≺ t}, ∼xi hB6 , xi = h{x –≺ p}, xi A DeLP-query α succeeds, i.e. , it is warranted from a program P , if it is possible to build an argument A that supports α and A is found to be undefeated by the warrant procedure. This process implements an exhaustive dialectical analysis that involves the construction and evaluation of arguments that either support or interfere with the query under analysis. That is, given an argument A that supports α , the warrant procedure will evaluate if there are other arguments that counter- argue or attack A or a sub-argument of A ( C is a sub-argument of A if C ⊆ A ). An argument hB , β i is a defeater (or counter-argument ) for hA , αi at literal β if A∪B ∪Π is contradictory; that is, if there exists a sub-argument hA ′ , α′ i of hA, αi such that α′ and β disagree. Two literals disagree when there exist two contradictory literals that have a strict derivation from Π ∪ {α′ , β}. The literal α′ is referred to as the counter-argument point and hA ′ , α′ i as the disagreement sub-argument. Proposition 1 For any de. l.p. P and any argument hA, αi ∈ ArgsP , if A = ∅ then hA , αi has no defeaters from P . Proof: Since hA , αi ∈ ArgsP and A = ∅ , from Def. 1 we have that Π derives α. By reductio ad absurdum, let us assume that there is an argument hB , β i ∈ ArgsP such that B defeats A, hence A ∪ B ∪ Π is contradictory (see counter-argument). Afterwards, since A = ∅ , we have A ∪ B ∪ Π = B ∪ Π. This is absurd, since B is not compliant with cond. 1 in Def. 1. Finally, hA , αi has no defeaters from P . (cid:3) To establish if A is a non-defeated argument, defeaters for A are considered. A Dynamics of Know ledge in DeLP through Argument Theory Change 9 counter-argument D is a proper defeater for A if D is preferred to A, or it is a blocking defeater if they either have the same strength or are incomparable with respect to the preference criterion used. It is important to note that in DeLP the argument comparison criterion is modular and thus, the most appropriate criterion for the domain that is being represented can be selected. Nevertheless , in the exam- ples given in this paper we will abstract away from this criterion, since it introduces unnecessary complexity. Thus , preference between counter-arguments will be given explicitly by enumerating defeats between arguments. Since defeaters are arguments, there may exist defeaters for them, and defeaters for these defeaters, and so on. This will determine sequences of arguments which are referred to as argumentation lines. Definition 2 (Argumentation Line) Given a de. l.p. P , and arguments B1 , . . . , Bn from ArgsP , an argumentation line λ is any (non-empty) finite sequence [ B1 , . . . , Bn ] such that B i is a defeater of B i −1 , for 1 < i ≤ n.
