In a separate memo, Blavatnik praised Bronfman ’s work after he joined Warner Music’s board in 2004, saying: “ I watched Edgar take a neglected division of Time Warner and turn it into a paradigm of how a traditional media company could redefine itself for the digital age. ” Bronfman headed the $2,5 billion acquisition of Warner Music from Time Warner Inc in 2004 in partnership with a group of private equity investors led by Thomas Lee Partners. He is now working with potential investors on a new partnership which could see him return to the media space in the New Year though not necessarily in music, a person familiar with his plans said on Monday. He has several other business interests, including being a general partner of private equity firm Accretive and executive chairman of Global Thermostat. While Bronfman successfully made a healthy return for his private equity partners in the Warner Music deal, he has been criticized for losing a sizable portion of his family’s Seagram beverages fortune in transactions with Vivendi and Dupont between 1995 and 2000. One of his biggest successes in the music industry occurred in 1998, when Bronfman created the Universal Music Group by combining the former MCA Records with PolyGram Records .
