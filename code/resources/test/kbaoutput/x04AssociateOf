# William Miller  as the vice presidential candidate.  In  --- This Republican primary in many ways is quite similar to the 1964 Republican primary which included Barry Goldwater , Nelson Rockefeller , William Scranton , and George Romney , and pitted deeply divided east coast moderates against Midwest strong conservatives. One can draw their own comparisons but during that primary Rockefeller, while in a leading position, fell from the grace of conservatives when his wife, whom he had just married the prior year after divorcing his previous wife, had a baby. Goldwater was a little too conservative for some party bosses so Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton was drafted as the "most able to beat Johnson" candidate; that effort failed and accomplished little other than further divide the already divided party. At the convention, to further complicate the party's woes, Margaret Chase Smith of Maine was placed into nomination as the first official female candidate of a major party. Richard Nixon placed Goldwater into nomination and he eventually won. Ronald Regan gave the keynote address and Goldwater chose William Miller as the vice presidential candidate. In his acceptance speech, he said "extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.
