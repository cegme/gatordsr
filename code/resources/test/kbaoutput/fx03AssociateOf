# William Miller  , slated to become the Vice Presidential candidate.  Bill Miller  --- I had been very active on that convention floor. I was one of those trying to help bring about a united front among the black delegates in the hope of thwarting the Goldwater drive. George Parker had courageously challenged Goldwater in vain and Edward Brooke had lent his uncompromising sincerity to the convention. I sat in with them after the nomination as they agonized about what they should do. Some were for walking out of the convention and even out of the party. Others felt that, as gloomy as things looked, the wisest idea was to remain within the party and fight. Throughout the convention, I had been interviewed several times on network television. When I was asked my opinion of Barry Goldwater , I gave it. I said I thought he was a bigot. I added that he was not as important as the forces behind him . I was genuinely concerned, for instance, about Republican National Committee Chairman William Miller , slated to become the Vice Presidential candidate. Bill Miller could have become the Agnew of his day if he had been elected. He was a man who apparently believed you never said a decent thing in political campaigning if you could think of a way to be nasty, insinuating, and abrasive. What with the columns I had written about Goldwater , The Saturday Evening Post article, and the television and radio interview, I had achieved a great deal of publicity about the way I felt about Goldwater .

' A glammed up Spencer spit and sweated his way through, his upper lip curled and hanging on the microphone through every track, as Cafritz , dolled up like a hardened 50s bombshell, backed him up with a constant chorus of obscenity until, after closing the show with 'Evil Eye' and ending with Spencer 's final words of "so f ** * you," Cafritz smiled and wished the crowd a "happy Hanukkah and merry Christmas." Whether or not the attitude was all an act, there was one genuine moment of authentic attitude when an overeager fan stormed the stage to snatch Spencer 's set list, returning to the crowd only to have Spencer snatch it back.

# Kurt Wolf  and  Bob Bert  --- Friday, Dec. 23, 2011. -- Adam Robb / For The Jersey Journal Fourth night of 2011 Hanukkah concerts with Yo La Tengo in Hoboken gallery (8 photos) First to take the stage at last night's fourth of Yo La Tengo 's eight Hanukkah shows at Maxwell's, reunited garage rock band Pussy Galore wasted no time testing the crowd's enthusiasm for raging 80s punk, as Jon Spencer , Julie Cafritz , Kurt Wolf and Bob Bert opened their relentless forty minute fifteen song set with the antagonistic 'You Look Like a Jew. ' A glammed up Spencer spit and sweated his way through, his upper lip curled and hanging on the microphone through every track, as Cafritz , dolled up like a hardened 50s bombshell, backed him up with a constant chorus of obscenity until, after closing the show with 'Evil Eye' and ending with Spencer 's final words of "so f ** * you," Cafritz smiled and wished the crowd a "happy Hanukkah and merry Christmas." Whether or not the attitude was all an act, there was one genuine moment of authentic attitude when an overeager fan stormed the stage to snatch Spencer 's set list, returning to the crowd only to have Spencer snatch it back.

# It  is now easier to tell how many impressions your content is getting in relation to interactions – so, your content might appear in someone’s news feed, but that doesn’t mean they are clicking through or interacting with that specific piece of content.  One tip I’ll  --- Traditionally, in marketing, an ‘impression’ is defined as a measurement of the number of people a piece of advertising can reach. This is translated similarly in relation to the online domain and an ‘impression’ for social marketing can be defined as the quantity of times a piece of content or advert is served up on a web site. So , impressions on Facebook are generated by a piece of content that you post appearing in someone else’s news feed, for example: These ‘impressions’ that are counted on Facebook are perhaps the most basic element of Insights, but they do serve a valuable purpose. It is now easier to tell how many impressions your content is getting in relation to interactions – so, your content might appear in someone’s news feed, but that doesn’t mean they are clicking through or interacting with that specific piece of content. One tip I’ll give regarding this issue is to look for patterns in the content that attracts the most interactions; is it controversial? Does it relate to a specific sector of an industry? Ask similar questions and begin using that information to construct and release content optimised for social media consumption.

INTRODUCTION Computational process must be studied using the fixed model of computational device. This paper introduces the basic models of computation used in quantum in- formation theory. We show how these models are defined by extending classical models. We start by introducing some basic facts about clas- sical and quantum Turing machines. These models help to understand how useful quantum computing can be. It can be also used to discuss the difference between quantum and classical computation. For the sake of com- pleteness we also give a brief introduction to the main res- ults of quantum complexity theory. Next we introduce Boolean circuits and describe the most widely used model of quantum computation, namely quantum circuits. We focus on this model since many presented facts about quantum circuits are used in the following sections. Fi - nally we introduce another model which is more suited for defining programming languages operating on quantum memory — quantum random access machine ( QRAM ). We also describe selected examples of the existing quantum programming languages. We start by formu- lating the requirements which must be fulfilled by any universal quantum programming language. Next we de- scribe languages based on imperative paradigm – QCL (Quantum Computation Language) and LanQ. We also describe recent research efforts focused on implementing languages based on functional paradigm and discuss the advantages of a language based on this paradigm. As the example of functional quantum programming language we present cQPL. We introduce the syntax and discuss the features of the presented languages. We also point out their weaknesses. For the sake of completeness a few examples of quantum algorithms and protocols are presented. We use these examples to introduce the main features of the presented languages. Note that we will not discuss problems related to the physical realisation of the described models. We also do not cover the area of quantum error correcting codes, which aims to provide methods for dealing with decoher- ence in quantum systems. For an introduction to these problems and recent progress in this area see e.g. [1, 2].
