Thanks!  --- I often read other blogs such as John Chows or Darren Rowse and I learn bits here and there about different things involved in Internet Marketing (by the way do visit the links to there sites, they are very interesting and they know their stuff, but do come back I need you more than them. Thanks! ) these guys are good at what they do, If I try something that they have written about then yes I might write about the same subject, but I won’t just copy their post.
