But , and it's a big one, the kids LOVED it. They picked it out for their very first Hanukkah , when they were about 10 months old, because when you press the button on the cover it tinnily plays "I Have a Little Dreidel". Over and over and over. But as a very first introduction to the holiday, it's kind of perfect. They learn the dreidel song, and see basic elements of celebration (family, menorahs , dreidels, etc.) in the bright illustrations. If only it came with ear plugs... Our First "About" Hanukkah Book Sammy Spider 's First Hanukkah by Silvia Rouss , illustrated by Katherine Janus Kahn Sammy Spider and his mother live on the ceiling of the Shapiro 's house, and Sammy is fascinated by watching them prepare for Hanukkah. He wants to celebrate too ! Between listening in on the family and talking with his mother, Sammy learns a lot, but he doesn't get to spin a dreidel, because spiders spin webs, not dreidels. But on the last night of Hanukkah , Sammy gets a surprise. The pictures are reminiscent of Eric Carle , which is appealing (in our family) to the kids and parents alike, and the story does give kids an excellent overview of a Hanukkah celebration.

The billionaire has been sued by Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky , who alleges that he was cheated out of the true value of his shares in the Russian oil giant Sibneft and aluminium giant Rusel. The Chelsea football club owner told the judge the problems of having a private jet, when he was asked if they were fuelled all the time so they could phone ahead and take off. The business tycoon said that it was not that easy and if he wanted to go somewhere it could take up to six hours before he was airborne saying it was not like a car where "you put keys into the ignition, off you go." "From the moment when I decide that I want to fly out until the moment until I am able to fly out, the very minimum would be four hours, and more likely it would be six hours," the Daily Mail quoted Abramovich as saying.

The billionaire has been sued by Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky , who alleges that he was cheated out of the true value of his shares in the Russian oil giant Sibneft and aluminium giant Rusel. The Chelsea football club owner told the judge the problems of having a private jet, when he was asked if they were fuelled all the time so they could phone ahead and take off. The business tycoon said that it was not that easy and if he wanted to go somewhere it could take up to six hours before he was airborne saying it was not like a car where "you put keys into the ignition, off you go." "From the moment when I decide that I want to fly out until the moment until I am able to fly out, the very minimum would be four hours, and more likely it would be six hours," the Daily Mail quoted Abramovich as saying. He said it was a lengthy complicated procedure to first contact the crew and get the jet fuelled up and get permission to take off. He then had to get from his office or home to the airport and depending on traffic jams it could take up to two hours.

[ Ελα να ζήσεις την ζωή σου έξω κάμποσες δεκαετίες νεοέλληνα για να καταλάβεις RUSSIA | 26.11.2011Russia's oligarchs act quietly in the background Oligarchs have lost their might, despite their money The number of billionaires is on the rise in Russia. But gone are the times when oligarchs wielded considerable influence in the country's politics. The Khodorkovsky case has left its mark on Russia's rich. Ever heard of Vladimir Lisin? He 's known as Russia's richest man; US magazine Forbes has estimated his wealth at $24 billion (18 billion euros). But the 55-year-old head of steel giant NLMK is unlikely to be recognized in the street, neither at home nor abroad. Lisin shuns the media and prefers to act in the background. Like most Russian oligarchs today, he seems to have very little political ambition. There is, however, one exception: Mikhail Prokhorov . With $18 billion in the bank, he is number three on Forbes ' list of the richest Russians. In the summer, he caused controversy when he joined the liberal-conservative party Right Cause as leader, so he could take part in the December election. By mid-September, he had resigned after an internal dispute and called the party a "puppet" of the Kremlin . He has since disappeared from the political stage. The Khodorkovsky lesson Khodorkovsky felt the full force of Russian lawRich businessmen like Lisin or Prokhorov are known as oligarchs in Russia. In the last two years, their number has increased threefold. According to Forbes , Russia boasts 101 US-dollar billionaires. But while they had considerable influence in the 1990s, those times are well and truly in the past. Russia 's richest men have learned their lessons thanks to the Khodorkovsky case, according to Sergey Alexashenko , the former vice president of the Russian Central Bank. He is now a lecturer at Moscow State University of Economics. Mikhail Khodorkovsky , who a decade ago was Russia's richest man, fell out with then President Vladimir Putin . He openly criticized the Kremlin for the country's widespread corruption. Shortly after that, he was arrested and convicted of tax fraud. His oil company Yukos was dismantled and he remains in prison, despite protests from Western governments. Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gussinsky , who were among the most powerful men in Russia in the 1990s, have long lost their influence. Both owned media empires, both criticized Putin and both now live abroad. Those oligarchs that remained in Russia have understood that trying to challenge the Kremlin is an exercise in futility, according to Alexashenko. "These days, the oligarchs work with the government and do their lobbying quietly in the background," he said. Secret service warning But although the oligarchs wield less influence than they did in the 1990s, they should not be underestimated, says Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov , who was deputy prime minister during Boris Yeltsin 's administration. Steel magnate Vladimir Lisin is worth some $24 billion " If oligarchs give Putin 's party United Russia money, is that not having influence?," he said. "These days, it's those that served with Putin when he was stationed in Germany or those that have worked with him when he was deputy mayor in St. Petersburg who become influential billionaires," said Nemtsov . He claims it's mainly secret service agents who "become rich people." The names he mentions - Timchenko , Rotenberg or Chemezov - are not well known. Scapegoats no more Mikhail Vinogradov , head of the St. Petersburg Politics foundation, agrees the relationship between the government and the oligarchs has changed since the 1990s. State-owned companies like Gazprom have muscled in on private firms and are now calling the shots, according to Vinogradov. The oligarchs , he says, have no impact on Prime Minister Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev , nor do they hold much sway in the strategically important regions in Russia. But although the Kremlin has clipped the oligarchs ' wings, it no longer uses them as whipping boys. Most recently, Putin tried to woo billionaires and send them into schools to tell the students of their success stories. Authors: Roman Goncharenko , Jegor Vonogradov / ng Editor: Martin Kuebler dw

With $18 billion in the bank, he is number three on Forbes ' list of the richest Russians. In the summer, he caused controversy when he joined the liberal-conservative party Right Cause as leader, so he could take part in the December election. By mid-September, he had resigned after an internal dispute and called the party a "puppet" of the Kremlin . He has since disappeared from the political stage. The Khodorkovsky lesson Khodorkovsky felt the full force of Russian lawRich businessmen like Lisin or Prokhorov are known as oligarchs in Russia. In the last two years, their number has increased threefold. According to Forbes , Russia boasts 101 US-dollar billionaires. But while they had considerable influence in the 1990s, those times are well and truly in the past. Russia 's richest men have learned their lessons thanks to the Khodorkovsky case, according to Sergey Alexashenko , the former vice president of the Russian Central Bank. He is now a lecturer at Moscow State University of Economics. Mikhail Khodorkovsky , who a decade ago was Russia's richest man, fell out with then President Vladimir Putin . He openly criticized the Kremlin for the country's widespread corruption. Shortly after that, he was arrested and convicted of tax fraud. His oil company Yukos was dismantled and he remains in prison, despite protests from Western governments. Boris Berezovsky and Vladimir Gussinsky , who were among the most powerful men in Russia in the 1990s, have long lost their influence. Both owned media empires, both criticized Putin and both now live abroad. Those oligarchs that remained in Russia have understood that trying to challenge the Kremlin is an exercise in futility, according to Alexashenko. "These days, the oligarchs work with the government and do their lobbying quietly in the background," he said. Secret service warning But although the oligarchs wield less influence than they did in the 1990s, they should not be underestimated, says Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov , who was deputy prime minister during Boris Yeltsin 's administration. Steel magnate Vladimir Lisin is worth some $24 billion " If oligarchs give Putin 's party United Russia money, is that not having influence?," he said. "These days, it's those that served with Putin when he was stationed in Germany or those that have worked with him when he was deputy mayor in St. Petersburg who become influential billionaires," said Nemtsov . He claims it's mainly secret service agents who "become rich people." The names he mentions - Timchenko , Rotenberg or Chemezov - are not well known. Scapegoats no more Mikhail Vinogradov , head of the St. Petersburg Politics foundation, agrees the relationship between the government and the oligarchs has changed since the 1990s. State-owned companies like Gazprom have muscled in on private firms and are now calling the shots, according to Vinogradov. The oligarchs , he says, have no impact on Prime Minister Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev , nor do they hold much sway in the strategically important regions in Russia. But although the Kremlin has clipped the oligarchs ' wings, it no longer uses them as whipping boys. Most recently, Putin tried to woo billionaires and send them into schools to tell the students of their success stories. Authors: Roman Goncharenko , Jegor Vonogradov / ng Editor: Martin Kuebler dw

# Jon Krakauer  ’s assault was overkill] lacking in basic elements of fairness, balance, perspective, insight and context.  … Mortenson  --- "It's [ “ Into Thin Air ”] there in print forever. It 's part of history. People should be above taking someone else down. And for what? For money and egos people are willing to destroy other people to further their careers." -- David Breashears , (“ Improper Bostonian” , 9-24-97) On April 17, 2011 CBS’s “60 Minutes ” aired their expose of Greg Mortenson (best-selling author of “Three Cups of Tea”). Jon Krakauer (best-selling author of “Into Thin Air ”) said that Mortenson tells a “beautiful story, and it’ s a lie” and “uses Central Asia Institute ( CAI ) as his private ATM machine. ” This expose resulted in a dramatic drop in Mortenson ’s book sales and donations to CAI. So , it ’s rather ironic that after his break with Mortenson in 2004, Krakauer had written: “ I still believe in CAI’s mission … I don ’t want to make any public statements that would have a negative impact on Greg’s work….” So then, seven years later, what prompted Jon Krakauer to speak out on “60 Minutes” and write his e-book “Three Cups of Deceit”? Well , Krakauer was not just a “ jilted crank” or “crusading do-gooder” outraged by literary deceit and lax accounting practices. It appears that Krakauer ’s e-book was also a publicity stunt whose publication was timed with the “60 Minutes” broadcast (that was largely based on research spoon-fed to them by Krakauer ) to create the “buzz ” to raise the investment capital needed to launch his old friend Mark Bryant ’s start-up of Byliner. Once Mortenson comes out of seclusion, he certainly needs to answer questions about his literary and financial practices. However , I believe Krakauer also needs to answer questions about how he “ got onto the Mortenson story ” (but, like Mortenson , Krakauer isn ’t talking to the press). And , while it certainly appears that Greg Mortenson confabulated parts of his ”inspirational story,” Jon Krakauer has also had “credibility problems” with his own books. Krakauer displayed hypocrisy by “throwing stones” when his own hands are not clean of deceit. Overall, I believe Daniel Glick (at his .net blog) has offered the most balanced commentary on this affair: “[‘60 Minutes’ and Jon Krakauer ’s assault was overkill] lacking in basic elements of fairness, balance, perspective, insight and context. … Mortenson is neither a saint nor a charlatan; Krakauer is not either a jilted crank or a crusading do-gooder. There are nuances, debatable “ facts” and conflicting motivations in almost every situation, messy and at times seemingly irreconcilable. This is no exception. ” . . .

Jon Krakauer (best-selling author of “Into Thin Air ”) said that Mortenson tells a “beautiful story, and it’ s a lie” and “uses Central Asia Institute ( CAI ) as his private ATM machine. ” This expose resulted in a dramatic drop in Mortenson ’s book sales and donations to CAI. So , it ’s rather ironic that after his break with Mortenson in 2004, Krakauer had written: “ I still believe in CAI’s mission … I don ’t want to make any public statements that would have a negative impact on Greg’s work….” So then, seven years later, what prompted Jon Krakauer to speak out on “60 Minutes” and write his e-book “Three Cups of Deceit”? Well , Krakauer was not just a “ jilted crank” or “crusading do-gooder” outraged by literary deceit and lax accounting practices. It appears that Krakauer ’s e-book was also a publicity stunt whose publication was timed with the “60 Minutes” broadcast (that was largely based on research spoon-fed to them by Krakauer ) to create the “buzz ” to raise the investment capital needed to launch his old friend Mark Bryant ’s start-up of Byliner. Once Mortenson comes out of seclusion, he certainly needs to answer questions about his literary and financial practices.

# Jon Krakauer  ’s assault was overkill] lacking in basic elements of fairness, balance, perspective, insight and context.  … Mortenson  --- "It's [ “ Into Thin Air ”] there in print forever. It 's part of history. People should be above taking someone else down. And for what? For money and egos people are willing to destroy other people to further their careers." -- David Breashears , (“ Improper Bostonian” , 9-24-97) On April 17, 2011 CBS’s “60 Minutes ” aired their expose of Greg Mortenson (best-selling author of “Three Cups of Tea”). Jon Krakauer (best-selling author of “Into Thin Air ”) said that Mortenson tells a “beautiful story, and it’ s a lie” and “uses Central Asia Institute ( CAI ) as his private ATM machine. ” This expose resulted in a dramatic drop in Mortenson ’s book sales and donations to CAI. So , it ’s rather ironic that after his break with Mortenson in 2004, Krakauer had written: “ I still believe in CAI’s mission … I don ’t want to make any public statements that would have a negative impact on Greg’s work….” So then, seven years later, what prompted Jon Krakauer to speak out on “60 Minutes” and write his e-book “Three Cups of Deceit”? Well , Krakauer was not just a “ jilted crank” or “crusading do-gooder” outraged by literary deceit and lax accounting practices. It appears that Krakauer ’s e-book was also a publicity stunt whose publication was timed with the “60 Minutes” broadcast (that was largely based on research spoon-fed to them by Krakauer ) to create the “buzz ” to raise the investment capital needed to launch his old friend Mark Bryant ’s start-up of Byliner. Once Mortenson comes out of seclusion, he certainly needs to answer questions about his literary and financial practices. However , I believe Krakauer also needs to answer questions about how he “ got onto the Mortenson story ” (but, like Mortenson , Krakauer isn ’t talking to the press). And , while it certainly appears that Greg Mortenson confabulated parts of his ”inspirational story,” Jon Krakauer has also had “credibility problems” with his own books. Krakauer displayed hypocrisy by “throwing stones” when his own hands are not clean of deceit. Overall, I believe Daniel Glick (at his .net blog) has offered the most balanced commentary on this affair: “[‘60 Minutes’ and Jon Krakauer ’s assault was overkill] lacking in basic elements of fairness, balance, perspective, insight and context. … Mortenson is neither a saint nor a charlatan; Krakauer is not either a jilted crank or a crusading do-gooder. There are nuances, debatable “ facts” and conflicting motivations in almost every situation, messy and at times seemingly irreconcilable. This is no exception. ” . . .

# Jon Krakauer  ’s assault was overkill] lacking in basic elements of fairness, balance, perspective, insight and context.  … Mortenson  --- "It's [ “ Into Thin Air ”] there in print forever. It 's part of history. People should be above taking someone else down. And for what? For money and egos people are willing to destroy other people to further their careers." -- David Breashears , (“ Improper Bostonian” , 9-24-97) On April 17, 2011 CBS’s “60 Minutes ” aired their expose of Greg Mortenson (best-selling author of “Three Cups of Tea”). Jon Krakauer (best-selling author of “Into Thin Air ”) said that Mortenson tells a “beautiful story, and it’ s a lie” and “uses Central Asia Institute ( CAI ) as his private ATM machine. ” This expose resulted in a dramatic drop in Mortenson ’s book sales and donations to CAI. So , it ’s rather ironic that after his break with Mortenson in 2004, Krakauer had written: “ I still believe in CAI’s mission … I don ’t want to make any public statements that would have a negative impact on Greg’s work….” So then, seven years later, what prompted Jon Krakauer to speak out on “60 Minutes” and write his e-book “Three Cups of Deceit”? Well , Krakauer was not just a “ jilted crank” or “crusading do-gooder” outraged by literary deceit and lax accounting practices. It appears that Krakauer ’s e-book was also a publicity stunt whose publication was timed with the “60 Minutes” broadcast (that was largely based on research spoon-fed to them by Krakauer ) to create the “buzz ” to raise the investment capital needed to launch his old friend Mark Bryant ’s start-up of Byliner. Once Mortenson comes out of seclusion, he certainly needs to answer questions about his literary and financial practices. However , I believe Krakauer also needs to answer questions about how he “ got onto the Mortenson story ” (but, like Mortenson , Krakauer isn ’t talking to the press).
