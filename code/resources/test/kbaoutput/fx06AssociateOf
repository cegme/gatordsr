# Eva Silverstein  and  Neil Turok  --- (47) must be checked for any interval I on the reheating surface, however since the entropy in this example is monotonically decreasing with yr it will be enough to consider just the intervals I = [y 0 r , ∞ ) for every y 0 r . Notice that the total volume is bounded by 6Nc hV i = e(√Ωx−√Ωx−1)x = e where Sc is the entropy as calculated at the value of the Hubble constant corresponding to the r of the reheating surface and we used the relation x = 6√ΩxNc . It follows classical exit point y cl that the bound is trivially satisfied on any interval I = [y 0 r , ∞ ) with y 0 r < yc since Z ∞ dyr hV (yr )i < hV i < eSc /2 < eS ( y0 r )/2 . y0 r r > y cl We just need to show now that the bound is not violated when y 0 r . For ( Ω − 1 )( x2 + ∆ y 2) ≫ 1, hV ( yr )i behaves like √ Ωxx+√Ωy∆y−√ ( Ω−1 )( x2 +∆y2 ) , hV ( yr )i ∼ e r (since hV ( yr )i is peaked around hyr i < y cl which is a falling exponential for yr > y cl r ). Therefore the integral in the l.h.s. of eq. (47) is dominated by the value of the integrand at y 0 r . We thus need to check whether 1+√ 1− 1 1 Ωx < eSc /2 (65) (63) (64) (66) hV (y 0 r )i < e up to pre-exponential factors. At leading order in the slow roll approximation we also have that r ) = Sc − 2pΩy (y 0 r − y cl S (y 0 r ) and looking only at the exponents of (66) we have pΩxx + pΩy∆y − p(Ω − 1)(x2 + ∆y 2) < 2 − pΩy (y 0 Sc r − y cl r ) . Using the fact that x = 6√ΩxNc and defining δy = y 0 r − y cl r , after a bit of algebra we get 6√ ΩNc √Ω − 1vuut1 + 12ΩNc − 1 (cid:19)  > 0 . x δy Ωx ! + √Ω (cid:18) Sc x − 2r Ωy δy This is the sum of two terms. The first is positive and the second is also positive since Sc > ∆S = Sc − Sstart = 12ΩNc . Ωx Ω (68) (67) S ( y0 r ) 2 , 18 Of course, the bound continues to hold even when ( Ω − 1 )( x2 + ∆ y 2) ≫ 1 is not satisfied—right before entering the phase of eternal inflation—because the distribution of volumes move further towards large negative values of yr where the bound is trivially satisfied because the volume produced in I is smaller. Notice also that the l. h.s. of (68) is minimized at δy = ∆yc (corresponding to y 0 r = y ), where we get 12ΩNc − 1(cid:19)(cid:21) > 0 , 6Nc ( cid:20)pΩx √Ω − 1 + Ω (cid:18) Sc which can be saturated only when Sc = ∆ S and Ω = 1, which implies Ωy = 0 , i. e. the untilted potential of the previous section, corresponding in practice to single-field inflation. This shows that tilting the reheating surface with respect to the gradient in field space actually makes the bound stronger. It also suggests that only single field slow-roll inflation manages to actually saturate the bound, any other multifield models which move further away from the symmetric setup of the single field case, seem to make the bound stronger, by producing less volume.

A Some explicit computations ν In this appendix we report some of the calculations omitted in section 4. First we show that any given Lagrangian L , generic function of the metric gµν , the Riemann tensor Rµν ρσ and scalar quantities φ, with no explicit covariant derivatives, can be rewritten just in terms of the Riemann tensors with two covariant and two contravariant indices ( Rµν ρσ and Rµ ρ σ ) without any explicit dependence on the metric gµν , i.e. L(gµν , Rµν ρσ , ..., φ) = eL ( Rµν Any term in L can be viewed as a network of nodes and lines, each node corresponding to the insertion of a Riemann tensor, each line to the contraction of two indices with a metric. Each node has thus four lines attached to it. The statement (70) corresponds to showing that the lines of each network can be oriented such that each node has two incoming and two outgoing lines (see fig. 4). σ , ..., φ ) . (70) ρσ , Rµ ν ρ 19 Figure 4: Each node corresponds to the insertion of a Riemann tensor, each link to the contraction of a pair of indices. Closed orientable loops can be identified such that al l nodes wil l end up having an equal number of incoming and outgoing lines. Hence any scalar contraction of Riemann tensors can be written just in terms of Riemann tensors with two upper and two lower indices contracted without using the metric. Consider now a node of the network and let start following a line departing from it. Since every node has an even number of lines attached, when the line arrives to a node there will be another line which has not been used yet, which can be followed, until eventually the path will close arriving back to the initial node. At this point we have a closed path which we can orient. Each node in this path will have an equal number of incoming and outgoing lines and an even number of unused lines. We can thus repeat the construction by starting with another unused line, forming another closed loop and orienting it. When we will have used all the available links we will have oriented all lines such that an equal number of incoming and outgoing line will pass through each node. This proves eq. (70). We prove now that the equations of motion (24) can be rewritten as in eq. (26). First we use that ρσ , Rµ ν ρ eL(Rµν σ , ..., φ) = eL(Rαβρσ gαµg βν , Rαν βσ gαµg βρ , ..., φ) δ eL δ1 eL = gαµgβν δRµν δ1Rαβρσ ρσ δ2 eL δ eL = gαµgβρ δRµ ρ δ2Rαν βσ ν where δn /δnRµν ρσ means that we only differentiate with respect to the Rµν ρσ appearing in the n-th σ 20 ρ σ + ρ ν σ ρσ + ρ σ ρ σ (71) αβγ , + = .

(26) from eq. (24). The last missing step to explicitly show the universality of the bound with respect to higher derivative terms, is the relation between the variation of the de Sitter entropy and the metric equations of motion, in particular how to get eq.

# Abuse  ''as attempting to cause or causing physical harm to another or placing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm, and  "Harassment  --- Judge Christopher Muse ’s ochlocratical choice to continue Dee D. 's initial HPO request hearing after I and his clerk told him I was not provided with a copy of Dee D. ’s complaint denied me my right to due process to hear a full and precise statement of the charges made against me and adequate time to prepare a defense against the charges. Moreover Muse's decision to accept Dee D. ’s interpretation that the person who “abused” her was a COGger who was inspired into racism after he saw the 72-year-old photo of Butterfly McQueen ’ s character in Gone With the Wind on my website doesn’t meet the basic element of Chapter 258e law that defines " Abuse ''as attempting to cause or causing physical harm to another or placing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm, and "Harassment ''as 3 or more acts of willful and malicious conduct aimed at a specific person committed with the intent to cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property and that does in fact cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property by force, or by threat or duress causes another to involuntarily engage in sexual relations. In the police report and the HPO hearing Dee D. averred that she never met me before which make the physical element an oxymoron unless I'm Plastic Man. Dee D.’ s claim that someone other than me followed her on Sept. 3, and 18, on October 10th, and again on November 2nd was irrelevant and inherently inadmissible because it was based on assumption and feelings, not fact. My two appearances in Judge Muse 's courtroom gave me a deja vu feeling I was in a chapter of the Cucible (Salem witch trials).

# Bob Freeman  , and  Cohan  --- Belatedly, the news media came around to the realization that Giuliani and his cohorts had screwed Bob Freeman : Said the Wall Street Journal the week after Freeman ended his ordeal with a plea bargain: " Rudy Giuliani promised new indictments in `record time' and asserted that the original charges were just the `tip of an iceberg. ' Last week, the iceberg turned out to be an ice cube, and even it melts under close scrutiny." Said The Daily News : "The government's behavior in that case reflects what many defense lawyers have called a display of sloppiness and arrogance that has needlessly ruined careers and reputations in the government's anti-fraud crusade." Newsday called Freeman "the Willie Horton of Rudolph Giuliani 's mayoral ambition." Wrote Robert Reno : "They could never find anything on the guy they handcuffed, but not to be left looking entirely like a bunch of loutish brownshirts, federal prosecutors scratched around for two years, combed the details of Freeman 's existence, and found a wholly unrelated charge to which it was conveniently arranged for him to plead guilty...in Robert Freeman 's martyrdom all of us were brutalized by Handcuff Giuliani ." Cohan 's book is the first to really detail the ordeal of Bob Freeman , and Cohan should be commended for doing so.
