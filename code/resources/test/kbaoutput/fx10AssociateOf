# When  will the experts in the treasury finally see that an economy doesn't grow because demand rises? Demand rises because an economy grows. Posted on 14 November 2011 by  Douglas Carswell  --- Far from fixing the "credit crunch", low rates have made things worse. With little incentive to save, there's been no build up of savings. So now the government is about to start credit rationing easing. If they kept the price a grain artificially low they'd be needing to ration bread, too. There's an obvious free market answer. Worse , pushing down the cost of credit has stimulated over consumption, discouraged saving and encouraged more borrowing. How does that fix a debt crisis? How much worse do things need to get before the Treasury recongise that a monetary stimulus, just like a fiscal stimulus, cannot conjure up prosperity?

Anu/An is known as the god of heaven, lord of constellations, king of gods, Consort of Antu and dwelt in the highest heavenly regions.

# Lawless  ne'er-do-wells and sophomoric Marxists occupy downtown locations across the country, the first of which was  Zuccotti Park  --- By now we know the basic elements of the Occupy Wall Street movement. Lawless ne'er-do-wells and sophomoric Marxists occupy downtown locations across the country, the first of which was Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan . Despite apparently substantial student loans , none of the protestors seems capable of coherent thought or complete sentences. Predictably and just like the last time their parents were away, crime, property damage, drugs, booze and sex are rampant, proving only that the protestors are not representative of 99% of this country.
