# p.m. // Tea Time  for the Traditionally Built by  Alexander McCall Smith  --- Tea Time for the Traditionally Built – Alexander McCall Smith Meeting the 3rd Sunday of each month at 1:00 p.m. // Tea Time for the Traditionally Built by Alexander McCall Smith is the tenth in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series and while not a page-turner like books by Grisham or Child, it provides a mellow change from other, more frenetic mysteries. Sitting down with Precious Ramotswe is like sitting down to tea with a good friend. There ’s philosophy, there’s human foibles, there’s humor, there’s national pride and there’s love, a whole lot of love, be it for a little white van or for a country or for a man. The mysteries in this series are never ones concerning blood and guts, which makes for a nice break. The mystery in this particular book concerns why a soccer team isn’t winning as it should. Is someone throwing the games?
