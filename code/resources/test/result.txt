We can peg them pretty easily: they are the Edinburgh versions of people we might meet in Zabars. But what can we make of Lacour?

To persuade voters, we may need legislation ahead of the election. In any case I doubt this will happen - Cameron , as noted above, has set his face against an in/out referendum.

# William Miller  as the vice presidential candidate.  In  --- This Republican primary in many ways is quite similar to the 1964 Republican primary which included Barry Goldwater , Nelson Rockefeller , William Scranton , and George Romney , and pitted deeply divided east coast moderates against Midwest strong conservatives. One can draw their own comparisons but during that primary Rockefeller, while in a leading position, fell from the grace of conservatives when his wife, whom he had just married the prior year after divorcing his previous wife, had a baby. Goldwater was a little too conservative for some party bosses so Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton was drafted as the "most able to beat Johnson" candidate; that effort failed and accomplished little other than further divide the already divided party. At the convention, to further complicate the party's woes, Margaret Chase Smith of Maine was placed into nomination as the first official female candidate of a major party. Richard Nixon placed Goldwater into nomination and he eventually won. Ronald Regan gave the keynote address and Goldwater chose William Miller as the vice presidential candidate. In his acceptance speech, he said "extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.

You mean we can rid a good young player for, er, another good young player (and not an old Otis Thorpe , old Issac Austin , old Mitch Richmond , old Bernard King , etc., etc., etc.) You bet yoâ$##! I know this is something outsiders donâ t wanna hear, but Iâ  m a tell it like it is â  McGee is a McBUM to any organization playing sub .500 ball. Not only does the kid think he is better than his actual skill set, but now he got his momma talking up for him . He does NOT have the heart and drive and intelligence defensively of Tyson Chandler. He does NOT have the motor of Andre Jordan. He does NOT have the worth ethic of, hell, Joel Anthony. So what are we specifically holding on to here? Face it: His stats are more "swole" than â   Big Poppa Pump â  during his WCW reign â  anyone who actually WATCHES basketball games can attest that fact. Heâ s a live body, with no moves, who fails to show up as soon as you put a body on him , who immaturity always overshadows any decent play he makes. Offâ   em asap. His trade value wonâ  t get any higher than it is RIGHT now. Cut Andray Blatche We have all heard of the saying â  addition by subtractionâ   right? We spent more money in past years paying dudes that were no longer on our roster (see Lorenzo Williams , for example), so cut your loses, and keep it moving.

Lewis is a cancer on the this roster for multiple reasons, but Iâ  ll only mention 3 out of 50. One , everyone knows what heâ  s getting paid this season (22 million). Two , everyone knows he wonâ  t produce a 5 th of what his salary is. Third , everyone knows heâ  s never been a â mentorâ   type player to younger guys. I can go on and on like Erykah Badu , but, this is another â  addition by subtractionâ   case here, something us Bullets/Wizards fans are used to dealing with with the team roster year after year.

Wall DESERVES it â He has done nothing but been a model citizen and player since being drafted by the Wizards. Only us, the Bullets/Wizards, can have an organization in the booming gentrified Nationâ s Capital, can draft two #1 overall picks in the last 10 years, obtain Michael Jordan during that stretch, and still only compiled a record of 340-497 as of January 24, 2012. Yeah , here is another shameful fact â   Juwan Howard , until further notice, will remain the lone Bullets/Wizards lottery pick in the last 30 years to achieve some sort of brilliance while in a D.C . uniform. Yeah , THAT Juwan . Trade JaVale McGee Is this a young Wizard veteran with TRADE VALUE HERE? When was the last time you heard such? You mean we can rid a good young player for, er, another good young player (and not an old Otis Thorpe , old Issac Austin , old Mitch Richmond , old Bernard King , etc., etc., etc.) You bet yoâ$##! I know this is something outsiders donâ t wanna hear, but Iâ  m a tell it like it is â  McGee is a McBUM to any organization playing sub .500 ball. Not only does the kid think he is better than his actual skill set, but now he got his momma talking up for him . He does NOT have the heart and drive and intelligence defensively of Tyson Chandler. He does NOT have the motor of Andre Jordan. He does NOT have the worth ethic of, hell, Joel Anthony. So what are we specifically holding on to here? Face it: His stats are more "swole" than â   Big Poppa Pump â  during his WCW reign â  anyone who actually WATCHES basketball games can attest that fact. Heâ s a live body, with no moves, who fails to show up as soon as you put a body on him , who immaturity always overshadows any decent play he makes. Offâ   em asap. His trade value wonâ  t get any higher than it is RIGHT now. Cut Andray Blatche We have all heard of the saying â  addition by subtractionâ   right? We spent more money in past years paying dudes that were no longer on our roster (see Lorenzo Williams , for example), so cut your loses, and keep it moving. I bet once this kat leaves D.C. , he wonâ t be in the league more than 2 additional seasons. What more can I say ? Use â Amnesty Clauseâ on Rashard Lewis Hey Ernie Grunfield , just act like you never traded Gilbert Arenas. You see what Orlando did to Arenas , right? What the hell are you guys waiting on? Lewis is a cancer on the this roster for multiple reasons, but Iâ  ll only mention 3 out of 50. One , everyone knows what heâ  s getting paid this season (22 million). Two , everyone knows he wonâ  t produce a 5 th of what his salary is. Third , everyone knows heâ  s never been a â mentorâ   type player to younger guys. I can go on and on like Erykah Badu , but, this is another â  addition by subtractionâ   case here, something us Bullets/Wizards fans are used to dealing with with the team roster year after year. Fire Ernie Grunfield Mr.
