die of
pass away of
killed
fade away
Expression
Assume room temperature
At peace 
At rest 
Beyond the grave
Beyond the veil 
Dead as a dodo 
Dead as a doornail
Done for 
Drop dead 
Food for worms 
In Abraham's bosom 
King of Terrors 
Not long for this world 
Off the hooks 
On one's deathbed
On one's last legs
One's hour has come 
One's number is up
Promoted Glory
Six feet under 
Sleeps with the fishes
Tango uniform
The Grim Reaper 
answer the final summons 
be fading away
be struck down
bite the big one
bite the dust 
blow someone's brains out
breathe one's last 
buy the farm 
cash in one's chips 
come a sticky end 
count worms 
croak
depart this life
die with one's boots on
fall off one's perch 
give up the ghost 
go bung 
go for a Burton
go home in a box 
go over the Big Ridge 
go a better place 
go a Texas cakewalk 
go to Davy Jones's locker 
go one's reward 
go one's watery grave 
go the big  in the sky
go to, or head for, the last roundup 
go west 
hand in one's dinner pail 
have bought it
have one foot in the grave 
hop on the last rattler 
hop the twig 
join the choir invisible 
join the great majority 
kick the bucket
kick the calendar
lose one's life 
make the ultimate sacrifice 
meet one's maker 
pass away 
pass in one's alley 
pay the ultimate price 
peg out 
pop one's clogs
push up daisies
put one the sword
ride the pale horse 
send one eternity or the Promised Land
shuffle off this mortal coil 
snuff it 
take a dirt nap
take a last bow
take one's life 
turn up one's toes 
up and die
Until one's dying day 
Wearing a pine overcoat
With one's last breath
