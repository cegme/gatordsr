Movoto Helps Floridians Navigate Effects of New Housing Aid Funds
Hard hit Florida real estate market could see a bounce-back in coming months
Tweet
PALM BEACH, Florida, July 14 /PRNewswire-HISPANIC PR WIRE/ -- Florida ( http://www.movoto.com/real-estate/homes-for-sale/florida.html) is one of five states where local housing agencies will soon be receiving millions in federal aid from the Housing Finance Agency Innovation Fund for the Hardest Hit Housing Markets. Florida will receive $418 million to fund programs to help struggling homeowners as market prices continue to fall and foreclosure rates rise in many cities across the state.
Real estate brokerage, Movoto.com, announced today that they have expanded their listings in Florida to aid homebuyers and sellers with free access to up-to-date market statistics and certified top-performing real estate agents in their area.
"Navigating today's real estate market is not something homeowners want to do on their own," said Movoto CEO Henry Shao ( http://www.movoto.com/about.aspx). "Low interest rates and low prices lead many people to view Florida as a buyer's market, but the reality is that many consumers who are searching for a home are also selling a home in the same market. In Florida, that means they might be getting a good deal on a new home, but they are also losing money in a sale. It is important that homeowners work with an agent who has experience in foreclosures and short sales to ensure that they are taking advantage of the laws and programs that are being created daily to aid those struggling in this market."
Movoto.com has added an additional 84,000 listings to their free Florida homes for sale listings ( http://www.movoto.com/property/fl/miami.html) powered by the Multiple Listings Service (MLS). With new access to the MLS in Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton, Palm Beach and dozens of other Florida cities, users can now also access statistics for local cities such as school performance on state tests, crime, distressed properties, average sale prices and more.
The services of Movoto.com are offered free of charge to consumers. There is no obligation to buy a home with an agent who partners with the service. For more information and to start looking for your new home or to quick start your sale listing today, visit www.movoto.com.
